# La Prairie: JavaScript

Welcome to the JavaScript folder.

## Structure

The file consists of 48 exercises, divided into 7 series.  
Don't be afraid of the number: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.  
The exercises follow one another in a logical _relatively_ way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.

Each exercise must be done.  
NOTE: **Note: **The exercises in series 7 are a little more complex, worth a try: they are good syntheses of the progress made.

## Progress

1. Base

        This one is not done yet, the rerun on cancel does not work yet

2. Math
    - Make a calculator work
    - Make a calculator work with a switch statement
        This one is not done yet
    - Calculate square numbers
    - Sort numbers
        Can't remember if I finished this one, to be checked
    - Calculate factorial
    - Log fizz or buzz or fizzbuzz when number can be divided by 3, 5 or 3 and 5

3. Colors
    - Change backgroundcolor to color stated on button
    - Change backgroundcolor to input value
    - Change backgroundcolor to random color

5. Arrays

    - Loop through array and log every element in the console
    - Log every array element with foreach
    - Log the firstname of every element with foreach
    - Find a specific element in an array and log some information about this
    - Filter array and create a new array with some specific elements from the first array
    - Check if an array includes a certain element
    - Do some math expressions on array elements
    - Remove duplicates from an array
6. DOM
7. Miscellanious
8. Asynchronous
9. Fetch

#### Local server

Some exercises may require running the code on a _local server_.  
This is a good practice that should always be applied. I recommend that you install[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machines, then install[**sèvè**](https://github.com/leny/seve), a small utility that generates a local server from your command line.
